    "intro": "Hey, I'm James – a project manager who loves turning complex challenges into simple solutions. Over the past three years, I've managed projects ranging from government digital services to startup tech platforms. Most recently, I've been working at Roam, where I helped build tools that make visa applications less of a headache for travellers. Before that, I spent two years in London's local government, where I learnt to navigate complex stakeholder requirements whilst delivering real impact for communities. I'm PRINCE2 and Agile certified, speak fluent French, and have a keen interest in how technology can make processes better for everyone."
