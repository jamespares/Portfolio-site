          <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              At ROAM, our visa application platform aimed at tourists, students, and digital nomads, 
              we sought to expand our global reach. Recognizing the need to cater to a diverse international 
              audience, we aimed to localize our website into multiple languages to enhance user experience, 
              increase engagement, and improve our search engine visibility in new markets.
            </p>

            <h2>Action</h2>
            
            <h3>Evaluated Translation Approaches</h3>
            
            <h4>API-Based Translation</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Considered using translation APIs (e.g., Google Translate API) for on-the-fly translations.</li>
              <li>Drawbacks Identified:
                <ul>
                  <li>Slower page load times due to real-time API calls.</li>
                  <li>Less control over translation quality.</li>
                  <li>Potential negative impact on SEO because content is rendered dynamically.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Internationalization Libraries (i18n)</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Explored using libraries like react-intl or i18next within our React application.</li>
              <li>Challenges Noted:
                <ul>
                  <li>Increased complexity in code management.</li>
                  <li>Client-side rendering could hinder SEO performance.</li>
                  <li>Possible performance overhead affecting user experience.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Static Internal Folder with Translation Script (Chosen Approach)</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Decided to generate static pages for each language by storing translations in an internal folder structure.</li>
              <li>Implementation Details:
                <ul>
                  <li>Used Next.js for Static Site Generation (SSG), creating pre-rendered pages for optimal load times.</li>
                  <li>Developed a custom Node.js translation script to automate extraction and management of text content.</li>
                  <li>Collaborated with professional translators to ensure high-quality, contextually accurate translations.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

                  <li>Each language version had unique URLs (e.g., www.roam.com/en/, www.roam.com/fr/).</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Implemented hreflang Tags:
                <ul>
                  <li>Added hreflang attributes to indicate language and regional targeting to search engines.</li>
                  <li>Prevented duplicate content issues by clarifying the relationship between different language versions.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>

                <ul>
                  <li>Customized meta titles and descriptions for each language.</li>
                  <li>Generated and submitted separate sitemaps for each language version to search engines.</li>
