            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              At ROAM, an innovative visa application platform for tourists, students, and digital nomads, 
              we faced a critical challenge: aggregating comprehensive and accurate visa information from 
              numerous sources worldwide. There was a need to automate data collection and ensure the 
              highest level of data accuracy to better serve our users.
            </p>

            <h2>Action</h2>
            
            <h3>Led Development of AI-Powered Web Scraping Tool</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Managed the creation of an AI-powered web scraping tool using Python, leveraging industry-standard libraries such as Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium to collect visa-related data from over 195 country websites and government portals.</li>
              <li>Implemented rigorous data validation processes to ensure only high-confidence data was collected.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Utilized Anthropic API for Data Completion</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Integrated the Anthropic API to fill gaps in the collected data, using advanced AI capabilities to interpret and estimate missing information.</li>
              <li>Ensured that any AI-generated estimates were clearly labeled and differentiated from confirmed data, maintaining transparency with users.</li>
              <li>Employed confidence scoring mechanisms to assess the reliability of the AI-provided data, only incorporating information that met a high-confidence threshold.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Constructed a Fully Automated Data Pipeline</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Designed and implemented an ETL pipeline using Apache Airflow for workflow automation, ensuring timely updates and data integrity.</li>
              <li>Integrated the pipeline with a PostgreSQL database hosted on Supabase for efficient data storage and retrieval.</li>
              <li>Utilized Pandas and NumPy for data cleaning and transformation tasks, standardizing data formats across sources.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Established DevOps Practices</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Employed Docker for containerization, ensuring consistent development and production environments.</li>
              <li>Set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment processes.</li>
              <li>Used Git and GitHub for version control and collaborative development, facilitating seamless teamwork among developers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Impact</h2>
            
            <h3>Data Enhancement</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Successfully populated over 42,000 rows of highly accurate and up-to-date visa information, covering regulations from more than 195 countries.</li>
              <li>Filled data gaps using the Anthropic API, enhancing the completeness of our dataset while maintaining high confidence in data accuracy.</li>
              <li>Improved data retrieval speed by 40% through optimized database indexing and query performance tuning.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Operational Efficiency</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Reduced manual data entry tasks by 85%, reallocating over 500 man-hours annually to other critical business functions.</li>
              <li>Enhanced data accuracy and consistency, leading to a 25% decrease in user-reported errors and inquiries.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>User Satisfaction</h3>
